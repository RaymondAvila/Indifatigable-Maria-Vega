    <h2>Who I am </h2>
    <p>I am an 11th grader at the Urban Assembly School of Design and Construction. My passions lie in drawing and design. </p>
    <p> Some of my favorite colors are white, pink, purple, and black. I don't really have a favorite artist, but I do enjoy listening to Bad Bunny, and hispanic musician. My favorite movie is "Nothing to Lose" a movie about 2 men with nothing in common, who become unlikely companions.</p>
    <h3>My Lifes Goal</h3>
    <p>When I get older I want to start a company, that deals with digital and clothing design. </p>
    <p>I also want to be able to achieve what people have said it would have been impossible for me to achieve. </p>
